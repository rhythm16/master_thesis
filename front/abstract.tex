Hypervisors are extensively utilized in cloud computing settings as they manage
hardware resources for virtual machines, making their security a critical
concern. An attacker that exploits vulnerabilities in the privileged hypervisor
codebase can gain unfettered access to VM data, compromising their safety.
Previous attempts to retrofit hypervisors into small trusted cores have
limitations, as the security still relies on the implementation of the trusted
core. Recently, Rust adoption has been increasing for its strong memory safety
guarantees and performance efficiency. Leveraging Rust, our work focuses on
rewriting SeKVM, a secure Linux KVM hypervisor, into \rustsec{}, the first
Rust-based secure Linux/KVM hypervisor. \rustsec{} incorporates
\rustcore{}, a small trusted core, to protect VM confidentiality and integrity.
We addressed challenges in incorporating Rust TCB into Linux, bringing up
\rustsec{} on real hardware, and rewriting SeKVM's TCB in Rust. Additionally,
we minimized unsafe Rust usage, enclosed unsafe code within safe abstractions,
and utilized Rust's type system to ensure spatial memory safety.
Our implementation of \rustsec{} suggests a modest overhead compared to
mainline KVM and SeKVM. Our work demonstrates the practicality of securing
existing hypervisors through a C-to-Rust rewrite.
