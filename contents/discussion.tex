Although we hope that Rust can help us with reducing the effort needed to secure
software, it is challenging to solely rely on Rust to provide safety guarantees
comparable to formal verification. Rust does not model hardware features
such as memory translation done by the Memory Management Unit (MMU), and
exception levels. Consequently, when building software on top of these features,
the compiler cannot check for misconfiguration or logical errors.
Moreover, \rustcore{} is not guaranteed to be memory safe despite our best
efforts, as there are still portions of unsafe Rust code within Rcore that the
compiler cannot ensure memory safety for.
Further, formal verification can not only guarantee code safety, but also
correctness in terms of functionality.
In contrast, Rust alone cannot guarantee functional correctness, although Rust
autoverification tools introduced in \autoref{sec:fw} may offer some assistance
in this regard, albeit not to the extent of formal verification.
Conducting extensive testing may be a viable option to gain confidence in
ensuring the correct behavior of the software.
