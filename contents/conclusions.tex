\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented \rustsec{}, a Rust-based secure KVM hypervisor that
is based on Linux 5.15 and rewritten from the C-based Linux 4.18 SeKVM.
Similar to SeKVM, \rustsec{} delivers VM confidentiality and integrity
protection against an untrusted Linux host kernel integrated with KVM.
We overcame challenges in forward porting SeKVM to Linux 5.15, and rewriting
SeKVM's TCB in Rust.
Furthermore, unsafe raw pointer accesses in \rustsec{}'s TCB \rustcore{}
are protected by memory region
isolation, which leveraged Rust's compile-time checks and its strong type
system.
These measures, combined with Rust's high-performance nature, enable \rustsec{}
to ensure robust memory safety, accomodate flexible code modifications, and
maintain overall efficiency.
In our experiments, \rustsec{} preserves the performance efficiency of KVM,
demonstrating the practicality for deployments.
%Raw pointer accessses are segregated into a small amount of
%unsafe code to allow most hypervisor functionalities to be implemented in safe
%Rust, and memory region isolation is enforced by transforming raw pointers
%into references and custom types that check for bounds.
%Rust's type system is used to enforce memory region isolation.
