\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented \rustsec{}, the first Rust-based secure KVM hypervisor that
is rewritten from the C-based SeKVM.
Similar to SeKVM, \rustsec{} delivers VM confidentiality and integrity
protection against an untrusted Linux host kernel integrated with KVM.
We overcame challenges that surfaced during the C-to-Rust rewrite. We
integrated Rust into the Linux codebase, brought up \rustsec{} on Rpi-4B by
changing the method used for reserving memory, and rewritten the SeKVM's TCB in
Rust. Moreover, raw pointer accessses are segregated into a small amount of
unsafe code to allow most hypervisor functionalities to be implemented in safe
Rust. We also leverage Rust's compile-time checks to eliminate memory safety
bugs of the TCB. Rust's type system is used to enforce memory region isolation.
\rustsec{} preserves the performance efficiency of KVM, demonstrating the
practicality for deployments.
