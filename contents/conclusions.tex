\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented \rustsec{}, the first Rust-based secure KVM hypervisor that
is rewritten from the C-based SeKVM.
Similar to SeKVM, \rustsec{} delivers VM confidentiality and integrity
protection against an untrusted Linux host kernel integrated with KVM.
We overcame challenges that surfaced during the C-to-Rust rewrite. We
integrated Rust into the Linux codebase, rewritten SeKVM's TCB in Rust, and
brought up \rustsec{} on Rpi-4B by changing the method used for reserving
memory.
Furthermore, unsafe raw pointer accesses are protected by memory region
isolation, which leveraged Rust's compile-time checks and its strong type
system.
These measures, combined with Rust's high-performance nature, enable \rustsec{}
to ensure robust memory safety, accomodate flexible code modifications, and
maintain overall efficiency.
In our experiments, \rustsec{} preserves the performance efficiency of KVM,
demonstrating the practicality for deployments.
%Raw pointer accessses are segregated into a small amount of
%unsafe code to allow most hypervisor functionalities to be implemented in safe
%Rust, and memory region isolation is enforced by transforming raw pointers
%into references and custom types that check for bounds.
%Rust's type system is used to enforce memory region isolation.
