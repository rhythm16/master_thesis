\chapter{Assumptions and Threat Model}
\label{sec:threatmodel}

We assume a remote attacker or a curious administrator that aims to compromise
the integrity and confidentiality of VM data. An attacker can exploit bugs in
the host kernel integrated with KVM. A remote attacker cannot access the
hardware, so physical attacks such as cold boot attacks~\cite{coldboot}
attack and memory bus snooping are out of scope. On-site security
measure~\cite{googlesecuritywhitepaper} is assumed to be in place to prohibit
unauthorized physical access to the hardware.
Side-channel attacks~\cite{ristenpart09sc,zhang12sc,irazoqui15sc,zhang14sc,liu15sc,backes13sc}
are also excluded from our threat model.

We assume a VM does not voluntarily reveal its sensitive data, intentionally
or by accident. A VM can be compromised by a remote attacker that 
exploits vulnerabilities in the VM. We do not provide security features to 
prevent or detect VM vulnerabilities, so a compromised VM that involuntarily 
reveals its data is out of scope. However, attackers may try to attack 
other hosted VMs from a compromised VM for which we provide protection.
